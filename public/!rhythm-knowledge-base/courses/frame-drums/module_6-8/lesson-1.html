Let's learn the basic rhythm. Here is how we'll write it in text notation. 
<displayrhythm> D L L T L L </displayrhythm>
Please study the notation and compare it with how I play in the video. In this course, we are building your understanding of rhythm, so it's crucial to comprehend its notation and learn to think in this format.

Now, as you saw how I play it, please play along with this track. Start with slow tempo and slowly achieve the freedom to play the basic rhythm in tempo 120 bpm.

<p>Now, as you can play this 'plain' rhythm, let's add some spice. I mean, let's construct a phrase where you first play it slowly and then - 2 times faster. And here's a little math lesson.</p>

<p>When you have a rhythmic phrase A that takes, let's say, 2 seconds of time. Now, if I ask you to play it 2 times faster, it'll take not 2, but 1 second of time, right? So, we need to divide the time of A by 2. When I write it in text notation, I will also divide the rhythmic phrase by 2, signifying a reduction in the time for its performance. That's why you see "/2" down in the rhythm text.</p>

<p>So, listen to how it sounds and go ahead, play with a metronome, gradually increasing the tempo to 80 bpm. Good luck!</p>
