The most common situation in music is 4/4 beat rhythm, when you count "one two three four, one two three four...".
For dancers it would be common to count till 8. So 8 counts - it's also very organic for our perception.
But when we talk about 9/8, it means we have to count "One two three four five six seven eight nine, One two ...". And this is not organic at all (unless you have born in Turkey or India).

But if you will try to count this plain One to nine rhythm, you'll realize it is too long and it's difficult to keep your focus.
But there is a good solution: let's group the beats into groups of 2, 2, 2 and 3 counts. So, instead of counting from One to nine, we'll count: </p>
<code>One two <br>
One two <br>
One two <br>
One two three<br>
</code>
<p>It means we'll play three times "One two" and then we will switch once to "One two three". And again three times "One two" and then "One two three". And so on...</p>
<p>Ok, enough words. Here is the rhythm. Hit the "PLAY" button and play along with this track.</p>
