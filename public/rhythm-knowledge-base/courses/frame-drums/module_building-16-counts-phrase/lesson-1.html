<p>16 = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4</p>
<p>This is the most simple presentation of 16 counts. You just repeat 4 times a 4-count rhythmic shape. Let's try one of many possible patterns? Here on "one" you hit DUM which is followed by three snaps of the left hand: ring, middle, index finger.</p>

<p>
	But in fact this is not a 16 beat pattern, it is 4 counts, because all 4 parts are the same. Let's make this phrase really 16 beats. For this in the second repetition let's replace the DUM with TAK, then in line 3, we'll play again D L L L, and in line 4 we'll make two snaps in your right hand followed by two snaps in your left hand. Thus we'll still have 16 = 4 times 4, but each 4-beat pattern is different.
