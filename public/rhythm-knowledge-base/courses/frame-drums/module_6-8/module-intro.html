Welcome to the module dedicated to the <b>6/8 beat rhythm</b> on a frame drum.

Here, you'll learn how to play 6/8 and its different variations. You'll practice each of them separately and then combine them into small compositions. This is valuable for:
– enhancing the flexibility of your technique,
– improving your memory, and, ultimately,
– fostering improvisation skills.

Good luck!
