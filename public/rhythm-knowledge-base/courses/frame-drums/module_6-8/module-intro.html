<i>Welcome to the module dedicated to the <b>6/8 beat rhythm</b> on a frame drum.</i><br>
<br>
Here, you'll learn how to play 6/8 and its different variations. You'll practice each of them separately and then combine them into small compositions. This is valuable for:
<ul>
<li>enhancing the flexibility of your technique,</li>
<li>improving your memory, and, ultimately,</li>
<li>fostering improvisation skills.</li>
</ul>
Good luck!
