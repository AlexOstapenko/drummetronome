Playing the frame drum is an amazing skill. The drum itself is very graceful, deep, and meditative, with a mesmerizing sound.

This course is designed to:

- Establish a strong foundation in your technique,
- Address both small and significant aspects of playing,
- Ensure consistency and regularity in your practice.

I've not only developed a set of exercises but also created software for you to play along with. Simply put, it's a metronome that plays rhythms based on provided text notation. Therefore, it can play virtually any phrase or composition, and the great thing is that you can adjust the tempo, starting from very slow and gradually increasing it.

Enjoy the course and please make sure to play regularly, at least 10-20 minutes. Regularity is the key to success!
