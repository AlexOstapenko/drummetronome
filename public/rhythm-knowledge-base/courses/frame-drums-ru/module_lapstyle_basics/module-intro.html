<p class='course-style-title '>Lapstyle technique - what is it?</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the lapstyle technique involves placing the drum on your lap, pressing it against your thigh with your hand (for stability), and playing it with snaps and finger strikes. We may strike with individual fingers or group them to produce proper sound. The sounds can range from low to high, open to closed.</p>

<p>You'll master these techniques step by step in this tutorial.</p>

<p class='course-style-title '>How this module is organized</p>
<p>This module is organized as a set of small lessons, each moving you forward.
It may contain video demonstrations, text explanations, and rhythm player sections. These sections are very helpful because you can hear exactly that rhythmic phrase which we learn in the lesson. And, most importantly, you can adjust the tempo of any rhythm according to your level of technique and play along with it.

<p class='course-style-title '>Understanding Rhythm</p>
<p>
	Before we start, I want to point out one important thought. While we develop in rhythm, it is crucial to not only play it but also <b>understand</b> it. That's why I encourage you to work with the text notation of rhythms. This is the core of my method. If you can understand what is written and modify the rhythm by adding new variations yourself, you will progress much faster in your musicality. Finally, you'll start creating your music and improvising much faster.

<p>
	So, in this course, there will be a lot of engagement with the text notation of rhythm. In this first module, I will introduce you to the main lapstyle sounds and demonstrate how we write them (notation). You'll have the video to see and hear how each rhythm is played.
	With all being said, I wish you good luck, a little bit of patience, and a lot of joy during the course.
